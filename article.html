        Blockchain, the foundation of Bitcoin, has received
        extensive attentions recently. Blockchain serves as an immutable
        ledger which allows transactions take place in a decentralized
        manner. Blockchain-based applications are springing up, cov-
        ering numerous ﬁelds including ﬁnancial services, reputation
        system and Internet of Things (IoT), and so on. However,
        there are still many challenges of blockchain technology such
        as scalability and security problems waiting to be overcome.
        This paper presents a comprehensive overview on blockchain
        technology. We provide an overview of blockchain architechture
        ﬁrstly and compare some typical consensus algorithms used
        in different blockchains. Furthermore, technical challenges and
        recent advances are brieﬂy listed. We also lay out possible future
        trends for blockchain.

<p id="txt">Nowadays cryptocurrency has become a buzzword in both
    industry and academia. As one of the most successful cryp-
    tocurrency, Bitcoin has enjoyed a huge success with its capital
    market reaching 10 billion dollars in 2016 [1]. With a spe-
    cially designed data storage structure, transactions in Bitcoin
    network could happen without any third party and the core
    technology to build Bitcoin is blockchain, which was ﬁrst
    proposed in 2008 and implemented in 2009 [2]. Blockchain
    could be regarded as a public ledger and all committed
    transactions are stored in a list of blocks. This chain grows
    as new blocks are appended to it continuously. Asymmetric
    cryptography and distributed consensus algorithms have been
    implemented for user security and ledger consistency. The
    blockchain technology generally has key characteristics of
    decentralization, persistency, anonymity and auditability. With
    these traits, blockchain can greatly save the cost and improve
    the efﬁciency.
    Since it allows payment to be ﬁnished without any bank or
    any intermediary, blockchain can be used in various ﬁnancial
    services such as digital assets, remittance and online payment
    [3], [4]. Additionally, it can also be applied into other ﬁelds
    including smart contracts [5], public services [6], Internet of
    Things (IoT) [7], reputation systems [8] and security services
    [9]. Those ﬁelds favor blockchain in multiple ways. First of all,
    blockchain is immutable. Transaction cannot be tampered once
    it is packed into the blockchain. Businesses that require high
    reliability and honesty can use blockchain to attract customers.
    Besides, blockchain is distributed and can avoid the single
    point of failure situation. As for smart contracts, the contract
    could be executed by miners automatically once the contract
    has been deployed on the blockchain.
    Although the blockchain technology has great potential for
    the construction of the future Internet systems, it is facing a
    number of technical challenges. Firstly, scalability is a huge
    concern. Bitcoin block size is limited to 1 MB now while
    a block is mined about every ten minutes. Subsequently, the
    Bitcoin network is restricted to a rate of 7 transactions per
    second, which is incapable of dealing with high frequency
    trading. However, larger blocks means larger storage space
    and slower propagation in the network. This will lead to
    centralization gradually as less users would like to maintain
    such a large blockchain. Therefore the tradeoff between block
    size and security has been a tough challenge. Secondly, it has
    been proved that miners could achieve larger revenue than
    their fair share through selﬁsh mining strategy [10]. Miners
    hide their mined blocks for more revenue in the future. In
    that way, branches could take place frequently, which hinders
    blockchain development. Hence some solutions need to be put
    forward to ﬁx this problem. Moreover, it has been shown that
    privacy leakage could also happen in blockchain even users
    only make transactions with their public key and private key
    [11]. Furthermore, current consensus algorithms like proof of
    work or proof of stake are facing some serious problems. For
    example, proof of work wastes too much electricity energy
    while the phenomenon that the rich get richer could appear in
    the proof of stake consensus process.
    There is a lot of literature on blockchain from various
    sources, such as blogs, wikis, forum posts, codes, confer-
    ence proceedings and journal articles. Tschorsch et al. [12]
    made a technical survey about decentralized digital currencie</p>
